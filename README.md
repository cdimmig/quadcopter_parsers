This repository contains plugins for various drone platforms for use with the JHU Aerial Autonomy framework.  Only the dji_parser and quad_simulator_parser are actively maintained.  It is recommended to dsable the build for all packages which you do not need (e.g. by adding a CATKIN_IGNORE file to the package) and to start by only building the quad_simulator_parser.

The dji_parser requires DJI's Onboard-SDK-ROS version 3.2.3
